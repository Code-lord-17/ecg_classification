# Human Fatigue Detection using ECG with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for a 6-month academic project aimed at detecting human fatigue levels using ECG signals and deep learning techniques. The project was successfully published in an international journal and presented at the *International Conference on Data Science and Exploration in Artificial Intelligence (CODE AI 2025)* at MAHE, Dubai, UAE.

## üß† Project Overview

Fatigue is a major contributor to occupational and cognitive performance issues, especially in high-risk environments. This project explores the use of deep learning models on ECG signal datasets to classify fatigue states. The full-stack solution also includes a user-facing application built with Python Flask.

## üöÄ Features

- ECG signal acquisition and preprocessing
- Deep learning model (CNN-LSTM architecture)
- Real-time fatigue classification
- Python Flask-based web application
- REST API for model inference
- Dashboard for visualizing fatigue prediction results
